Batliboy Corp is proud to launch its maiden app for android devices. The app is designed for the travelers of Delhi Metro. The users can input stations by writing or by selecting from an auto-complete list. The app will help the users find the best possible way to get to their destinations. The users can view a detailed route of their journey including details like list of different stations in their journey, which metro to take etc.

This is a free version of the app and in the coming months we will be looking to expand on it and churn the errors. We are already working on adding features where users will be able to select route based on shortest train changes, least stations, and shortest time.

We all at Batliboy Corp hope that you will enjoy this app and feel free to review it and send us your feedback.

Cheers and happy navigation,

Batliboy Corp
